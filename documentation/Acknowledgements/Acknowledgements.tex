I would like to express my gratitude towards my advisor \href{mailto:stefan.keller@hsr.ch}{Prof. Stefan Keller} for suggesting this very neat project and assisting me throughout the whole journey. His great interest in geodata and spatial features made me (who didn't know anything about these topics before) very interested and engaged in them as well!\\
A huge thanks also goes to \href{mailto:nicola.jordan@hsr.ch}{Nicola Jordan} from the institute of HSR who helped me and gave me suggestions on how to code in Python and was just generally a great guidance for my first Python project.\\
A special thanks goes to all the authors of the Python libraries, Docker images and LateX templates that I used in order to complete this project.\\
I would also like to send some appreciation to the GitLab team for having such a nice and neat application lifecycle tool for me to utilize. It provided me with a code repository, CI/CD pipeline features and just generally a nice and consistent environment to have my application on.
